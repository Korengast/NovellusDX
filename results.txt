1. Best so far on vlidation set:
BayramogluetAl2017Model, epochs=10, batch_size=15, acc=0.699
* SHould test the other paper with bn


2. After data augmentation, using BayramogluetAl2017Model, I got 0.8125 acc on the validation set (mb size = 30, epochs = 10, resolution =(384, 384))

3. Gao et al 2017, epochs = 30 batch_size = 30, data = 192_rotate, activations = relu, relu, sigmoid instead of tanh, valid_acc = 0.83!! (with overfit)
4. Bayramoglu et al, epochs = 10 batch_size = 30, data = 192,  activations = relu, relu, sigmoid, no batch_norm, valid_acc = 0.78! (no overfit)
